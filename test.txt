1 Another head hangs lowly
2 Child is slowly taken
3 And the violence caused such silence
4 Who are we mistaken
5 But you see it's not me,
6 It's not my family
7 In your head, in your head they are fighting
8 With their tanks and their bombs
9 And their bombs and their guns
10 In your head, in your head they are cryin'
11 In your head, in your head
12 Zombie, zombie, zombie
13 What's in your head, in your head
14 Zombie, zombie, zombie
15 Another mother's breakin'
16 Heart is taking over
17 When the violence causes silence
18 We must be mistaken
